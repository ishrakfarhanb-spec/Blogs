  "body": "For generations, masculinity has been defined by narrow expectations: strong, unemotional, dominant, and often, distant. The man was the protector, the provider, the one who never showed vulnerability. But the 21st century is challenging that outdated narrative, offering a new, more inclusive definition of what it means to be a man.\n\nIn her book *The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love* (2004), bell hooks explores how traditional masculinity harms men themselves. She argues that society’s expectation for men to suppress emotions leads to isolation, mental health issues, and distorted relationships. In the past, men were conditioned to believe that showing emotion was a weakness. But today, there’s growing acceptance that emotional expression—whether through vulnerability or asking for help—is a sign of strength, not fragility.\n\nA significant cultural shift has occurred, especially with mental health awareness. Men are increasingly encouraged to talk about their struggles, to seek therapy, and to embrace their emotional selves. This change in narrative has given rise to more diverse representations of masculinity, where being sensitive or introspective is no longer seen as “unmanly.” In fact, this new perspective is being celebrated as a more genuine, fulfilling way to live.\n\nA pop culture example of this shift is actor and producer Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. Once known for his larger-than-life persona as a wrestler, Johnson has become an advocate for mental health, openly discussing his battles with depression. His willingness to share his struggles has helped redefine the idea of a “tough” man—showing that real strength comes from vulnerability and self-awareness.\n\nBut it’s not just about breaking down emotional barriers. The new masculinity is also about rejecting rigid gender roles. Men today are not limited to being the sole breadwinner or the stoic figurehead of the family. They’re embracing diverse roles—whether as stay-at-home dads, nurturers, or allies in the fight for gender equality. As *The Mask of Masculinity* by Lewis Howes (2017) explains, the pressure to conform to a specific, outdated version of manhood only holds men back from reaching their full potential.\n\nRedefining masculinity in the 21st century isn’t about abandoning strength; it’s about expanding the definition of what it means to be strong. It’s a call to embrace vulnerability, emotional depth, and authenticity—qualities that make men healthier, happier, and more connected to the world around them."
